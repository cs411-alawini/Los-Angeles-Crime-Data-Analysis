For example, if users plan to visit areas with recent theft reports, they may receive security alerts to protect their items. In addition, for users with specific concerns, such as parents of young children, the platform can provide safety advice for children.
- **Community participation and collaboration**: Integrate a feature that allows local community members to collaborate in community observation plans, share personal safety tips, and even organize community-based crime prevention activities. This will be facilitated through forums or community committees within the application.
- **Interactive data visualization**: Implement advanced data visualization tools that allow users to interactively explore crime data. For example, users can zoom in on specific communities on the map, view crime trends over a period of time, and even compare crime rates in different regions.
- **Personalized user dashboard**: Users can customize the dashboard to monitor specific areas of interest, track specific types of crimes, and even set alerts for certain crime thresholds.
